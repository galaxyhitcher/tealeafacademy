ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

  This error message tells me that too few arguments (1 rather than the required 2) were passed into the method calculate_product.
