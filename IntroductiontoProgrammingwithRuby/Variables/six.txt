NameError: undefined local variable or method `shoes' for main:Object
  from (irb):3
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'


This error message tells me that the local variable or method 'shoes' was used in the namespace
before it was defined or is defined outside the scope in which it is being called.
