The Object Model

1.) An object can be created by defining a class, and instantiating an instance
by using the .new method to create an instance, also known as an object.



2.) A module allows us to group reusable code into one place.  Modules can be
used in classes by using the include reserved word, followed by the module name.
Modules are used as a namespace.
