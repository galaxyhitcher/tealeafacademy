# ! is sometimes used at the end of a method name to permanently modify the caller to the 
# method.  ! is also used to negate some value that evaluates to a boolean true value.

# ? is sometimes used at the end of a method name to indicate that the method returns
# a true or false value.

# 1. != is essentially the "does not equal" comparison operator.  This comparison   
# operator # is used in if statements.

# 2. Putting ! before something, like !user_name, turns it into the opposite of it's boolean
# equivalent.

# 3. ! after a method name is a common way to denote that the method will destructively modify it's # caller.

# 4. ? before something indicates a ternary operator, i.e. 1==2 ? "true" : "false"
# it's caller

# 5. ? after a method often indicates that the method will return a boolean value.

# 6. !! before something, like !!user_name will negate it's boolean truth value twice.  An  \
# interesting side effect of this is that !! will return false.
